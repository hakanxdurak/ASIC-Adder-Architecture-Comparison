Carry-Ripple Adder:
A 32-bit carry-ripple adder is implemented by cascading eight stages, each using two levels of logic.
The critical path delay is approximately 32 times the delay of a single full-adder stage.
Each two-level logic stage consists of two gates: one AND gate and one OR gate.

Results:
Critical path delay ≈ 4.38 ns ≈ 32 × (delay of a full adder) ≈ 32 × 14ns
Total area = 154.5 µm²
